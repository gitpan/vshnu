The files in this directory can be installed and merged into your home
directory Unix environment to implement an integration between a tcsh
command line shell and a vshnu (or vsh) visual shell (as a sort of
supplemental visual mode to tcsh).

It's all rather kludgy, but they're shiny, polished and well-tested
kludges :-)

Each file here contains its own instructions on what to do with and
about it.  "precmd" and "penv" will implement quick aliases to switch
to vshnu while communicating information between the shells.  "lo"
provides one convenient way to exit tcsh without having to exit vshnu
explicitly as well.  "vshnu.tcsh.diff" is an optional patch file for the
tcsh sources, which will suppress cluttering messages when suspending
from vshnu back to tcsh.

Here's a tcsh prompt setting for your ~/.tcshrc or ~/.cshrc file that
looks nice with vshnu:

	if ( $uid == 0 ) then
		set prompt = '%{\e[41m%}%m:%. #%{\e[0m%} '
	else
		set prompt = '%S%m:%.%s '
	endif
