The files in this directory can be installed and merged into your home
directory Unix environment to implement an integration between a bash
command line shell and a vshnu visual shell (as a sort of supplemental
visual mode to bash).

Each file here contains its own instructions on what to do with and
about it.  "vshnu-bash" implements the entire integration between vshnu
and bash.

Here's some notes from Marc Schaefer <marc_schaefer@gmx.de>,
the author of vshnu-bash:

	The script is self contained, installation is described in
	the comments preceding the code. It differs from the tcsh
	implementation in the following respects:

	* I want to use it in a multiuser environment where I do not
	  trust everybody, so the idea of writing to files with easily
	  predictable names in public directories does not really
	  appeal to me. vshnu-bash therefore creates one directory in
	  the temporary directory ($TEMP, $TMPDIR or /tmp, if none of
	  the vars is set) per shell to store the current directory and
	  the environment in.

	* [...] vshnu-bash a) keeps track of the PID of its vshnu and thus
	  is not confused if I start other processes with names starting
	  with vshnu and b) checks on every invocation whether this
	  process is still running and (if necessary) starts a new one.

	  The downside of this is that the check takes some time.

	* It is a kludge, but not as well tested as tcsh's. Actually,
	  until now it only Works For Me (TM). Bug reports welcome :)
